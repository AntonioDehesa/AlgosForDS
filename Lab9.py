# There is one answer that is commented, and one that is running. 
# The commented one was my first attempt. I basically tried to use the algorithm in the slides directly, but it failed. Some nodes in P were never visited so they did not get updated.
# It looks weird with extra comments and variables, because I was still trying to make it work, but then I tried the second way, so I just commented it in case the other one did not work.
# Then, the one that is running is a combination of the algorithm in the slides, what I did, and the provided code, which actually worked.
